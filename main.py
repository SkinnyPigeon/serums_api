This is an updated version of the Serums Datalake API. \
While the functionality remains the same, every single \
function has been evaluated and rewritten where needed, \
hopefully leading to a smoother experience when using \
as well as an easier time maintaining.

A big part of the change comes from the far more robust \
testing suite which now covers everything so finding issues \
in the future should be a much simpler task.

## Usage

You will require to have a few things in place to use the API. \
First, you must be able to log into the [Flexpass system]\
(https://flexpass.serums.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/web_app/login_username.html).\

Additionally, if you are testing staff members you will need to have \
rules stored on the blockchain for that member of staff. For instance, \
In the testing suite, you will see that there are various rules in \
place for the patient with the id of 117 and the medical professional \
with an id of 120 within USTAN.
